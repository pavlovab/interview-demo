# interview-demo, Github User to Freshdesk Contact

A command-line Python program, which retrieves the information of a GitHub User and creates a new Contact or updates an existing contact in Freshdesk.

The Python program can be run with the "python main.py -username -subdomain" command in the terminal while in v1/ directory of the project.
"username" and "subdomain" are positional arguments (strings) and are required for the program to run. 

To run all the tests for the Python program, the command 'python -m unittest discover' should be executed in the main directory of the project (in this case interview-demo/).
